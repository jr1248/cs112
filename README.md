Data structures projects from summer 2019 semester


Polynomial: In polynomial.java I had to fill in the add, multiply and evaluate methods. These methods added and multiplied 2 polynomials in a linked list, while evaluate returned the string representation of the final linked list.


DOM Tree: In tree.java we where asked to build and munipulate a binary tree of DOM elements.
